# ComputerVision
Project based on Computer Vision and Image Processing

1. Aim -> To Solve Game of UNBLOCK ME
2. Language, Libraries -> JAVA, OpenCV
3. Algorithms/Data structures -> Image Processing, Hash-Map, BruteForce-Path-Search
4. Things Done (3 things)
	1.Game Development -> Developed Game UNBLOCK ME in JAVA GUI (SWING)
	2.Puzzle Extraction -> Extract Game state from camera image
	3.Logic -> Once state of Game is acquired -> Solve it -> Find Series-of-MOVES which would solve the game
